This repository is a curated archive of my **LeetCode solutions** in **Java**, covering a wide spectrum of **Data Structures and Algorithms**. Each solution reflects not just correctness and efficiency, but also clarity and expressive coding style.

Whether you're brushing up on your fundamentals or preparing for interviews, these solutions are designed to be readable, reusable and refined.

## Structure

Solutions are organized by difficulty:
- `Easy/`
- `Medium/`
- `Hard/`

Each folder contains:
- Clean Java implementations
- Problem statements (linked via comments)
- Intuitive logic breakdowns

## How to Use

Clone the repo and explore the folders:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bangadhipati/Java-DSA.git
```

> ⚠️ **Note:** These solutions are tailored for the LeetCode platform and may not run directly in local IDEs (e.g., VS Code) without adapting input/output formats. They're best explored within LeetCode's online judge environment.

## Why This Matters

DSA isn't just about solving problems—it's about **thinking in patterns**, **writing with elegance** and **building mental models**. This repo is my personal journey through that landscape and I hope it helps you navigate yours.

_“Code is poetry. Algorithms are rhythm. Let your logic dance.”_
